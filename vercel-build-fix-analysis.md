# Vercel Build Error Analysis and Fix

## Problem Summary

The Vercel build was failing with the following error during static generation:

```
Error occurred prerendering page "/_not-found". Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/prerender-error
Error: Provided address was not an absolute URL.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error occurred because:

1. **Missing not-found page**: The app didn't have a custom `not-found.tsx` page, so Next.js was using its default not-found page
2. **Layout dependencies**: During static generation of the not-found page, Next.js was trying to render the layout which includes:
   - Navbar component (client component)
   - VibeKit SDK imports
   - Inngest configuration
   - Auth middleware
3. **URL handling issue**: The VibeKit SDK or related dependencies were making HTTP requests or creating URL objects with relative URLs during the build process, which is not allowed during static generation

## Error Trace Analysis

The error trace showed the following problematic imports:
- `./node_modules/@vibe-kit/sdk/dist/index.js`
- `./lib/inngest.ts`
- `./app/api/inngest/route.ts`
- `./app/actions/vibekit.ts`

## Solution Implemented

Created a custom `templates/v0-clone/app/not-found.tsx` page with the following characteristics:

1. **Standalone page**: Uses its own `<html>` and `<body>` tags to avoid the problematic layout
2. **No external dependencies**: Uses only basic HTML and inline styles
3. **Simple functionality**: Provides a basic 404 page with a link back to the home page
4. **No SDK calls**: Avoids any imports that could trigger the VibeKit SDK or other problematic dependencies during static generation

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
- `templates/v0-clone/app/not-found.tsx` (created)

### Key Features of the Solution:
- Self-contained HTML structure
- Inline styles to avoid CSS dependencies
- Basic anchor tag instead of Next.js Link to avoid additional imports
- Clean, functional 404 page

## Expected Outcome

This fix should resolve the Vercel build error by:
1. Preventing the problematic layout from being rendered during not-found page static generation
2. Avoiding any URL-related operations that could cause the "absolute URL" error
3. Providing a working 404 page for users

## Additional Notes

- There are TypeScript/JSX type configuration issues in the project that cause linter errors
- The main build issue should be resolved despite these linter warnings
- For a production deployment, consider fixing the TypeScript configuration to resolve the JSX type errors

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Fix TypeScript configuration**: Ensure proper React types are available
2. **Environment variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel
3. **SDK initialization**: Consider lazy loading or conditional initialization of the VibeKit SDK to avoid build-time issues
4. **Error boundaries**: Add proper error boundaries around components that use external SDKs
